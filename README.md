Gemma Wood Portfolio

Welcome to my Design and Development Portfolio. This portfolio showcases my skills, various projects, and how to contact me.

As a front-end web development student, I've created this portfolio to present my skills and projects to potential employers and to showcase what I have already learnt on this bootcamp. The portfolio incorporates core skills such as flexbox and media queries. The goal is to not only showcase my work but also to provide insights into the thought processes behind each project.

About

The sections in my portolio include The portfolio is broken down into sections which can be seen in my wireframes shown below. The 3 sections are as listed.

About Me: Read about me, what I enjoy and my skills.

Work: Explore a collection of my projects that I have made so far, along with my design portfolio and some social links with more projects soon to come!

Contact: Find out how to get in touch with me by Phone, Email or Github.

Clicking on any of these links will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section, providing a seamless user experience. Also, within the navbar when you hover over any item the colour changes.

With the importance of adaptability, my portfolio is designed to be responsive, the layout will adapt to your device. Media queries used ensure a smooth experience across various screens and devices.
